alignment_of_structures.png => alignment of predicted model (pink) with the experimentally obtained one (gray) of the "pocket" region where carboxamide binds to CDK8
Docking_refer_pink_wt+pos2_green.png => reference position of compound (pink) with pose 1 result from FastDRH (blue)
Docking_refer_pink_wt+pos1_blue.png => reference position of compound (pink) with pose 2 result from FastDRH (green) 
docking_all.png => Enter carboxamide compounds, a diverse class of molecules known for their pharmacological properties and structural versatility. Inspired by the potential of these compounds, our research team embarked on a quest to investigate their ability to modulate CDK8 activity and its implications for cancer treatment.
pos1_wt+pos10_m2+pos8_m3.png => The alternative binding sites (compounds are overlapping and shown in orange/green color) comparing to the pose 1 prediction for the wild-type.
alignment_of_structures.png  The difference in folding free energy (ΔΔG) of the 11 mutante that we are intersted in.
